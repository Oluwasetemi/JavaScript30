Hi there!

This repository is created to keep track of my progress in the awesome JavaScript 30 Day Challenge
and commiting & logging what I have learnt on daily basis.

Also, please have a look into the users I have helped so far regarding JavaScript30 course queries [here](/QUERIES.md).

If you have any JavaScript/JavaScript30 course realted queries, please create a new issue [here](https://github.com/palashmon/JavaScript30/issues/new). I will try to respond as soon as possible. I am always happy to help and learn new stuff from our JS community. 

Thanks!

**Tool Found:** [ESLint v3.13.1](http://eslint.org/blog/2017/01/eslint-v3.13.1-released) has been released today. 

### Day 12: 10 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** Learned about key sequence detection & Konami code. Also, found that [BuzzFeed site](https://www.buzzfeed.com/)'s hidden easter egg is still working. To see it in action just press ':arrow_up: :arrow_up: :arrow_down: :arrow_down: :arrow_left: :arrow_right: :arrow_left: :arrow_right: B A'. 

### Day 13: 11 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** Learned a bit more about window events & a very useful javascript debounce function. Today's project helped me to fix an issue related to resize events which was slowing down our site. The goal behind debounce implementation is to reduce overhead by preventing a function from being called several times in succession.

### Day 14: 12 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** Learned more about array & object reference vs actual copy. Found that primitive types are manipulated by value & reference types are manipulated by reference. Numbers and booleans are primitive types in JavaScript -- primitive because they consist of nothing more than a small, fixed number of bytes that are easily manipulated at the low (primitive) levels of the JavaScript interpreter. Objects, on the other hand, are reference types. Arrays and functions, which are specialized types of objects, are therefore also reference types. These data types can contain arbitrary numbers of properties or elements, so they cannot be manipulated as easily as fixed-size primitive values can. Since object and array values can become quite large, it doesn't make sense to manipulate these types by value, as this could involve the inefficient copying and comparing of large amounts of memory.

### Day 15: 13 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** Learned some useful stuff on local Storage & event delegation. 

Completed all of the project goals for today:-

### Day 16: 14 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** Today learned about assigning to new variable names using ES6 Object destructuring and how we can update CSS rules like textShadow or anything using javascript. Just like canvas this was a fun challenge today. I tried some css effects like this:-

### Day 17: 15 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:**  Updated code to show modified band names on which sort actually happens and on right side the actual band names. After code modifications it looks like this:-

### Day 18: 18 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** Learned more about `Array.prototype.reduce()` and its usability test case scenario. `reduce()` is quite simple & effective in specific scenarios like in the example below:-
