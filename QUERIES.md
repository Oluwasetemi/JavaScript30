 - **Query:** I am really trying to get the #02 css clock,  not to wind back. it does that janky thing when seconds hit 59.
 - **Response:** 
  - You can easily resolve this issue by not resetting but incrementing secondsDegrees value like ![img1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2T8mzhXUAM_r9t.jpg)
  - So, when seconds hand was at 59, secnDegrees was at 444 degree & once seconds hand is at 0 ![img2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2T-_jZXgAEe_On.jpg)
  - then secdegree jumps backward to 90 degree again causing the janky thing. I hope that makes sense now.
